## Object mode
- When moving the object in Object mode, the origin moves with the object.
- In other words, the origin maintains its relative position to the object (e.g. centre of the cube)

### Set Origin
- available through the Object menu when in Object mode
- Origin to Geometry - sets the origin of the object to the "centre" of the object's geometry (e.g. the centre of a cube)
- Origin to 3D Cursor - sets the origin of the object to the location of the 3D cursor

## Edit mode
- When moving the object in Edit mode, the origin stays in place while the object moves.
- Thus, moving the object in Edit mode changes the position of the origin relative to the object (e.g. moving the origin of a cuve from the centre to one of its corners).

## Toggling the visibility of an object's origin
- The origin of an object appears as an orange dot.
- The visibility of the dot which represents an object's origin may be toggled on or off through the Show Overlays menu.
