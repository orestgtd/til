Got this message when running Behat test:

```
Expected Step, but got text: "      | transaction_date | security_number | trade_action | position_effect | security_description      | quantity | price | commission | us_tax | net_transaction_amount" in file: /var/www/html/features/Confirmations/Import.feature
```

Turns out that I needed to add a pipe symbol at the end of the row header. It should look like this:
```
      | transaction_date | security_number | trade_action | position_effect | security_description      | quantity | price | commission | us_tax | net_transaction_amount |

```
